### Research Group at Linköping University

This repository contains the codes for papers from researchers of the ISAC group at Linköping University.

### About our group

One of the most promising features that will be integral part of the next generation of wireless mobile networks, 6G, is the integration of sensing functionality, which allow a better understanding of the surrounding context and precise localization of users and things.

Our research targets the design and evaluation of novel algorithms and schemes to enable an efficient co-design of sensing and communication functionalities and enhanced resolution for positioning and sensing.

Topics of interest include:

- Cell-free MIMO ISAC systems
- Distributed/Networked and multiband sensing
- Privacy-preservation in ISAC systems
- Trustworthiness of ISAC
- Sensing-assisted communications
