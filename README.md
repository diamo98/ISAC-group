### Research Group at Linköping University

This repository contains the codes for papers from researchers of the ISAC group at Linköping University.

### About our group

Our research targets the design and evaluation of novel algorithms and schemes to enable an efficient co-design of sensing and communication functionalities and enhanced resolution for positioning and sensing.

Topics of interest include:

- Cell-free MIMO ISAC systems
- Distributed/Networked and multiband sensing
- Privacy-preservation in ISAC systems
- Trustworthiness of ISAC
- Sensing-assisted communications
