**Abstract of the paper.** Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems are prone to privacy violations, once they aim at handling sensitive identifiable information in several applications. This paper raises the necessity of implementing privacy-preservation measures on the design of cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output ISAC systems. To that purpose, given an adversary model, we propose an iterative framework of two blocks, precoder design and access point selection. The precoder design aims at maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the sensing receivers given communication constraints. The access point selection aims at minimizing the mutual information between the received signal at users and the sensing signal, by rearranging the access points that transmit ISAC-signals and the sensing receivers. Results show that a reduction in the probability of detection by the adversary is obtained with this method.
